# My website
**Last updated: 16th November 2025**

This repository contains code that I use to host my website, [mikefuller.co.uk](https://www.mikefuller.co.uk). The design is an adaptation of a template from [TemplateMo.com](https://templatemo.com).

My website is a dynamic, desktop and mobile-friendly single page showing a basic introduction of myself, my professional experience, and programming portfolio.
